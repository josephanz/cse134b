Notes:
	Since internet explorer does not support html5 notification, we made a custom popup that 
	displays on the page along with the internet explore native pin site notification.  In addition,
	for the notification feature we added a toggle to enable or disable notifications in the add/edit a habit page, 
	and a time selector for when the notification will be displayed.  We removed the option to have specify a daily
	frequency greater than 3, added a log out button, added a close button on the add/edit page, added account recovery 
	functionality.  The progress bar in the habit list is based on the amount of times the habit was done out of the 
	daily frequency for that day.
