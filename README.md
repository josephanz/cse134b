- add_page and edit_page image selector does not work properly, it doesn't make a border around the selected icon in IE
- some buttons don't work on mobile. Due to research JQuery/Ajax issue. 
- login%20page.html and mainpage.html error(s): <button> tags are not redirecting in mobile/tablet browsers. we wrapped <a> tags around the button text (causing it to not validate) but makes it work on mobile and tablet browsers.
